## Introduction
I consider myself to be a polyglot and a full stack generalist. I thrive in environments where I feel like I'm challenged and am surrounded by people who can teach me something and to whom I can teach something.  

## Experience
### Pivotal Labs
New York, NY  
October 2013 —  

I have led teams working on projects for clients that ranged from startups fresh out of Y Combinator to massive international enterprises. I focus on delivering high quality software quickly and coaching client developers to do the same. I enable my clients to be successful when I'm gone by showing them how to test effectively and teaching them the value of short feedback loops in their entire development process.  

At Pivotal Labs, I've worked in the following ecosystems:  
* JavaScript (AngularJS, Backbone)
* Java (Spring, Spring MVC)
* Ruby (Rails)


### mobi
Austin, TX  
December 2011 — September 2013  

I worked on mobi's B2B suite of applications while it transitioned from a struggling startup with an all-Java, no-test culture to a profitable business with a diverse, test-driven tech stack. I overhauled their hiring process that allowed them to find candidates that are technically stronger and better fits within the team.  

At mobi, I worked with the following technologies:  
* JavaScript (AngularJS, Google Maps)
* Java (Spring, SpringMVC, Hibernate)
* Ruby (Sinatra)
* DevOps (Chef)
* SQL (Microsoft)

## Education
### Texas State University - BS Computer Science
San Marcos, TX

Graduated Summa Cum Laude
